# Pondering Paths

## Challenge 1: **The Root**
This challenge is to invoke the pwn directory using the command:
```
/pwn
```
### Understanding the command:
* **/**: backslash placed before the name of the file/directory.
* **pwn**: the program to invoke to grant access to the flag for this challenge.
* **/pwn**: understanding the meaning of an *absolute path* - one that starts with the root directory.
