# Pondering Paths

## Challenge 1: **The Root**
This challenge is to invoke the pwn directory using the command:
```
/pwn
```
### Understanding the command:
* `**/**` backslash placed before the name of the file/directory.
* `**pwn**` the program to invoke to grant access to the flag for this challenge.
* `**/pwn**` understanding the meaning of an *absolute path* - one that starts with the root directory.

### Flag Generation:
On running the command the following terminal output was displayed:
```
BOOM!!!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{IQCTyZb871USXd1E6h4nsDOzsUi.dhzN5QDL2MTO0czW}
```
Hence the flag was procured, copied (first into the pwn terminal and then from the pwn clipboard to make it accessible to the system clipboard), and pasted into the pwn.college challenge page.
