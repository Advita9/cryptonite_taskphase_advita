## Torrent Analyze

Challenge Description:
```
SOS, someone is torrenting on our network.
One of your colleagues has been using torrent to download some files on the companyâ€™s network. Can you identify the file(s) that were downloaded? The file name will be the flag, like picoCTF{filename}. Captured traffic.
```

Hints:
```
Download and open the file with a packet analyzer like Wireshark.

You may want to enable BitTorrent protocol (BT-DHT, etc.) on Wireshark. Analyze -> Enabled Protocols

Try to understand peers, leechers and seeds. Article

The file name ends with .iso
```

Captured traffic file:
```
https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/165/torrent.pcap
```

The file is opened in WireShark and based on the hints, the ```bt-dht``` filter is applied.

The most common local IP address found is ```192.168.73.132```, so that is added on to the filter:
```
bt-dht and ip.src_host == "192.168.73.132"
```
As we need to find the file downloaded through bit torrent, we need to utilize the info hash.

info hash is a 20 byte SHA-1 hash binary encoded.

All the protocols are traversed until one with info hash is found. In this case the first packet with that was packet 51080. 

The value is:
```
e2467cbf021192c241367b892230dc1e05c0580e
```

A google search is made and a .iso file is found on Linuxtracker (in line with hints).

Thus the flag is:
```
picoCTF{ubuntu-19.10-desktop-amd64.iso}
```
