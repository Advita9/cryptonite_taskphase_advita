# Shell Variables

## Challenge 1: **Printing Variables**
The challenge involves understanding the use of ```echo``` to print variables.

### Steps involved in approaching the challenge:
1. The prompt states that ```/challenge/run``` will not print the flag.
2. The prompt states that the ```echo``` commans needs to be used to print the flag.
3. The prompt also states that the flag is stored in the ```FLAG``` variables.

### Flag generation:
* Following the syntax to print a variables using ```$```, the following command is run:
```
echo $FLAG
```
* The following output is generated:
```
pwn.college{IVzM8hRlUsQPwXRFrtUykmgXp-I.ddTN1QDL2MTO0czW}
```
Hence the flag was procured, copied (first into the pwn terminal and then from the pwn clipboard to make it accessible to the system clipboard), and pasted into the pwn.college challenge page.
