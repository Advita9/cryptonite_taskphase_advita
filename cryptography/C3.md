## C3

The challenge description is as follows:
```
Description
This is the Custom Cyclical Cipher!
Download the ciphertext here.
Download the encoder here.
Enclose the flag in our wrapper for submission. If the flag was "example" you would submit "picoCTF{example}".
```

The hint provided is :
```
Modern crypto schemes don't depend on the encoder to be secret, but this one does.
```
The link for ciphertext is:
```
https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c_titan/47/ciphertext
```

The link for the encoder is:
```
https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c_titan/47/convert.py
```
The contents of the ciphertext file are:
```
DLSeGAGDgBNJDQJDCFSFnRBIDjgHoDFCFtHDgJpiHtGDmMAQFnRBJKkBAsTMrsPSDDnEFCFtIbEDtDCIbFCFtHTJDKerFldbFObFCFtLBFkBAAAPFnRBJGEkerFlcPgKkImHnIlATJDKbTbFOkdNnsgbnJRMFnRBNAFkBAAAbrcbTKAkOgFpOgFpOpkBAAAAAAAiClFGIPFnRBaKliCgClFGtIBAAAAAAAOgGEkImHnIl
```

The contents of the convert.py file are:
```
import sys
chars = ""
from fileinput import input
for line in input():
  chars += line

lookup1 = "\n \"#()*+/1:=[]abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
lookup2 = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTabcdefghijklmnopqrst"

out = ""

prev = 0
for char in chars:
  cur = lookup1.index(char)
  out += lookup2[(cur - prev) % 40]
  prev = cur

sys.stdout.write(out)

```

The first character of the plaintext is looked for in lookup1.
The index of that character is subtracted from the previous index and wrapped within the array of length 40 using %.
The current character index is saved as previous and then this is repeated.

This creates a custom cyclical cipher.

The contents of convert.py are copied to a new file using:
```
cp convert.py convert2.py
```
The new file is edited to finally :
```
import sys
chars = ""
from fileinput import input
for line in input():
  chars += line

lookup1 = "\n \"#()*+/1:=[]abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
lookup2 = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTabcdefghijklmnopqrst"

out = ""

prev = 0
for char in chars:
  cur = lookup2.index(char)
  this = lookup1[(cur + prev) % 40]
  out += this
  prev = lookup1.index(this)

sys.stdout.write(out)
```
Thus the logic is reversed. Each character of the ciphertext is taken, the index is found using lookup2, and the original index is calculated in lookup1.

The ciphertext is sent to convert2.py, and the output is sent to file.py using:
```
cat ciphertext | python3 convert2.py > file.py
```
The contents of file.py are read:
```
cat file.py
```

The output is:
```
a
d
l
i
b
s
```
This is wrapped around the flag format and final flag is:
```
picoCTF{adlibs}
```
