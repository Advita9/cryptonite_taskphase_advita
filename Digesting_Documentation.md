# Digesting Documentation

## Challenge 1: **Learning From Documentation**

This challenge involves an introduction to understanding the concept of reading documentation.

### Steps involved in approaching the challenge:
1. Reading the challenge prompt gives an understnading of the flag invocation through the ```/challenge/challenge``` command.
2. Further, it states that the argument to be added in order to correctly invoke the flag is ```giveflag```.

### Flag Generation:
* Understanding the challenge prompt correctly and applying that to the syntax of a command and its argument, the following command is typed in the commenad line to generate the flag:
```
/challenge/challenge --giveflag
```
* The following output is generated:
```
Correct argument! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{YbEZfp2lJlh7vxskP50H3lgH1Mr.dRjM5QDL2MTO0czW}
```
Hence the flag was procured, copied (first into the pwn terminal and then from the pwn clipboard to make it accessible to the system clipboard), and pasted into the pwn.college challenge page.
