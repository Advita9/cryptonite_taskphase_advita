# File Globbing

## Challenge 1: Matching with *

This challenge involves understanding the use of * as a **wildcard** to replace that argument with any files that match the pattern.

### Steps involves in approaching the challenge:
1. The prompt states that we need to navigate to the ```/challenge``` directory using at most 3 characters in the argument passed to ```cd```.
2. Follosing the prompt, the following command is run:
```cd /*ge```

### Flag Generation:
* The command leads the directory to change to ```/challenge```.
* The following command is run:
```
/challenge/run
```
* The following output is generated:
```
You ran me with the working directory of /challenge! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{kB6MZRQG85mP5UZAtsBV6ssrKyT.dFjM4QDL2MTO0czW}
```
Hence the flag was procured, copied (first into the pwn terminal and then from the pwn clipboard to make it accessible to the system clipboard), and pasted into the pwn.college challenge page.
