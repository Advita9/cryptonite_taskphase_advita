Welcome to OverTheWire!

If you find any problems, please report them to the #wargames channel on
discord or IRC.

--[ Playing the games ]--

  This machine might hold several wargames.
  If you are playing "somegame", then:

    * USERNAMES are somegame0, somegame1, ...
    * Most LEVELS are stored in /somegame/.
    * PASSWORDS for each level are stored in /etc/somegame_pass/.

  Write-access to homedirectories is disabled. It is advised to create a
  working directory with a hard-to-guess name in /tmp/.  You can use the
  command "mktemp -d" in order to generate a random and hard to guess
  directory in /tmp/.  Read-access to both /tmp/ is disabled and to /proc
  restricted so that users cannot snoop on eachother. Files and directories
  with easily guessable or short names will be periodically deleted! The /tmp
  directory is regularly wiped.
  Please play nice:

    * don't leave orphan processes running
    * don't leave exploit-files laying around
    * don't annoy other players
    * don't post passwords or spoilers
    * again, DONT POST SPOILERS!
      This includes writeups of your solution on your blog or website!

--[ Tips ]--

  This machine has a 64bit processor and many security-features enabled
  by default, although ASLR has been switched off.  The following
  compiler flags might be interesting:

    -m32                    compile for 32bit
    -fno-stack-protector    disable ProPolice
    -Wl,-z,norelro          disable relro

  In addition, the execstack tool can be used to flag the stack as
  executable on ELF binaries.

  Finally, network-access is limited for most levels by a local
  firewall.

--[ Tools ]--

 For your convenience we have installed a few useful tools which you can find
 in the following locations:

    * gef (https://github.com/hugsy/gef) in /opt/gef/
    * pwndbg (https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg) in /opt/pwndbg/
    * gdbinit (https://github.com/gdbinit/Gdbinit) in /opt/gdbinit/
    * pwntools (https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools)
    * radare2 (http://www.radare.org/)

--[ Tips ]--

  This machine has a 64bit processor and many security-features enabled
  by default, although ASLR has been switched off.  The following
  compiler flags might be interesting:

    -m32                    compile for 32bit
    -fno-stack-protector    disable ProPolice
    -Wl,-z,norelro          disable relro

  In addition, the execstack tool can be used to flag the stack as
  executable on ELF binaries.

  Finally, network-access is limited for most levels by a local
  firewall.

--[ Tools ]--

 For your convenience we have installed a few useful tools which you can find
 in the following locations:

    * gef (https://github.com/hugsy/gef) in /opt/gef/
    * pwndbg (https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg) in /opt/pwndbg/
    * gdbinit (https://github.com/gdbinit/Gdbinit) in /opt/gdbinit/
    * pwntools (https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools)

--[ Playing the games ]--

  This machine might hold several wargames.
  If you are playing "somegame", then:

    * USERNAMES are somegame0, somegame1, ...
    * Most LEVELS are stored in /somegame/.
    * PASSWORDS for each level are stored in /etc/somegame_pass/.

  Write-access to homedirectories is disabled. It is advised to create a
  working directory with a hard-to-guess name in /tmp/.  You can use the
  command "mktemp -d" in order to generate a random and hard to guess
  directory in /tmp/.  Read-access to both /tmp/ is disabled and to /proc
  restricted so that users cannot snoop on eachother. Files and directories
  with easily guessable or short names will be periodically deleted! The /tmp

--[ Playing the games ]--

  This machine might hold several wargames.
  If you are playing "somegame", then:

    * USERNAMES are somegame0, somegame1, ...
    * Most LEVELS are stored in /somegame/.
    * PASSWORDS for each level are stored in /etc/somegame_pass/.

  Write-access to homedirectories is disabled. It is advised to create a
  working directory with a hard-to-guess name in /tmp/.  You can use the
  command "mktemp -d" in order to generate a random and hard to guess
  directory in /tmp/.  Read-access to both /tmp/ is disabled and to /proc
  restricted so that users cannot snoop on eachother. Files and directories
  with easily guessable or short names will be periodically deleted! The /tmp
  directory is regularly wiped.
  Please play nice:

    * don't leave orphan processes running
    * don't leave exploit-files laying around
    * don't annoy other players
    * don't post passwords or spoilers
    * again, DONT POST SPOILERS!
      This includes writeups of your solution on your blog or website!

--[ Tips ]--

  This machine has a 64bit processor and many security-features enabled
  by default, although ASLR has been switched off.  The following
  compiler flags might be interesting:

    -m32                    compile for 32bit
    -fno-stack-protector    disable ProPolice
    -Wl,-z,norelro          disable relro

  In addition, the execstack tool can be used to flag the stack as
  executable on ELF binaries.

  Finally, network-access is limited for most levels by a local
  firewall.

--[ Tools ]--

 For your convenience we have installed a few useful tools which you can find
 in the following locations:

    * gef (https://github.com/hugsy/gef) in /opt/gef/
    * pwndbg (https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg) in /opt/pwndbg/
    * gdbinit (https://github.com/gdbinit/Gdbinit) in /opt/gdbinit/
    * pwntools (https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools)
    * radare2 (http://www.radare.org/)

## Level 11 to 12:
1. The password is rotated by 13 characters, which makes it a ROT13 cipher.
2. Since no inbuilt terminal decryption command exists, we create our own using ```tr``` command, the syntax for which is <old chars> <new chars>
3. The data in the file is read:
```
cat data.txt
```
4. Output:
```
Gur cnffjbeq vf 7k16JArUVv5LxVuJfsSVdbbtaHGlw9D4
```
5. We pipe this output as input into the self made cipher decrypter:
```
cat data.txt | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'
```
6. This transforms A to N and Z to M and same for lowercase (13 characters).
7. Output:
```
The password is 7x16WNeHIi5YkIhWsfFIqoognUTyj9Q4
```
8. The current level is ```exit```.
9. The next level is initiated:
```
ssh bandit12@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```
10. Output:

If you find any problems, please report them to the #wargames channel on
discord or IRC.

--[ Playing the games ]--

  This machine might hold several wargames.
  If you are playing "somegame", then:

    * USERNAMES are somegame0, somegame1, ...
    * Most LEVELS are stored in /somegame/.
    * PASSWORDS for each level are stored in /etc/somegame_pass/.

  Write-access to homedirectories is disabled. It is advised to create a
  working directory with a hard-to-guess name in /tmp/.  You can use the
  command "mktemp -d" in order to generate a random and hard to guess
  directory in /tmp/.  Read-access to both /tmp/ is disabled and to /proc
  restricted so that users cannot snoop on eachother. Files and directories
  with easily guessable or short names will be periodically deleted! The /tmp
  directory is regularly wiped.
  Please play nice:

    * don't leave orphan processes running
    * don't leave exploit-files laying around
    * don't annoy other players
    * don't post passwords or spoilers
    * again, DONT POST SPOILERS!
      This includes writeups of your solution on your blog or website!

--[ Tips ]--

  This machine has a 64bit processor and many security-features enabled
  by default, although ASLR has been switched off.  The following
  compiler flags might be interesting:

    -m32                    compile for 32bit
    -fno-stack-protector    disable ProPolice
    -Wl,-z,norelro          disable relro

  In addition, the execstack tool can be used to flag the stack as
  executable on ELF binaries.

  Finally, network-access is limited for most levels by a local
  firewall.

--[ Tools ]--

 For your convenience we have installed a few useful tools which you can find
 in the following locations:

    * gef (https://github.com/hugsy/gef) in /opt/gef/
    * pwndbg (https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg) in /opt/pwndbg/
    * gdbinit (https://github.com/gdbinit/Gdbinit) in /opt/gdbinit/

## Level 12 to 13:
1. The file has been compressed using gzip, bzip2 and tar multiple times.
2. According to instructions, we create a temp directory:
```
mktemp -d
```
3. ```ls```

4. Output:
```
/tmp/tmp.yPViQtiznv
data.txt
```
5. We copy to the new temp dir:
```
cp data.txt /tmp/tmp.yPViQtiznv
```
6. We move into the new dir:
```
cd /tmp/tmp.yPViQtiznv
```
7. Then we rename ```data.txt``` to ```data``` as its not a text file:
```
mv data.txt data
```
8. ```ls```

9. Output:
```
data
```
10. We convert the hex data to binary using:
```
xxd -r data > binary
```
11. ```ls```

12. Output:
```
binary data
```
13. To check the type of binary:
```
file binary
```

Output:
```
binary: gzip compressed data, was "data2.bin", last modified: Thu Sep 19 07:08:15 2024, max compression, from Unix, original size modulo 2^32 574
```
14. We rename ```binary```:
```
mv binary binary.gz
```
15. We decompress according to ```gzip```:
```
gzip -d binary.gz
```
16. ```ls```

17. Output:
```
binary  data
```
18. ```file binary```

Output:
```
binary: bzip2 compressed data, block size = 900k
```
19. ```mv binary binary.bz```
20. ```bzip2 -d binary.bz```
21. ```file binary```

Output:
```
binary: gzip compressed data, was "data4.bin", last modified: Thu Sep 19 07:08:15 2024, max compression, from Unix, original size modulo 2^32 20480
```
22. mv binary binary.gz
23. gzip -d binary.gz
24. ```file binary```

Output:
```
binary: POSIX tar archive (GNU)
```
25. ```tar -xf binary```

```x``` is for data and ```f``` is for filename.
26. ```ls```

27. Output:
```
binary  data  data5.bin
```
28. ```file data5.bin```

Output:
```
data5.bin: POSIX tar archive (GNU)
```
29. ```tar -xf data5.bin```

29. ```ls```

30. output:
```
binary  data  data5.bin  data6.bin
```
31. ```file data6.bin```

32. ```mv data6.bin data6.bz```

33. ```bzip2 -d data6.bz```

34. ```ls```

35. Output:
```
binary  data  data5.bin  data6
```
36. ```file data6```
Output:
```
data6: POSIX tar archive (GNU)
```
37. ```tar -xf data6```

38. ```ls```

39. Output:
```
binary  data  data5.bin  data6  data8.bin
```
40. ```file data8.bin```

Output:
```
data8.bin: gzip compressed data, was "data9.bin", last modified: Thu Sep 19 07:08:15 2024, max compression, from Unix, original size modulo 2^32 49
```
41. ```mv data8.bin data8.gz```

42. ```gzip -d data8.gz```

43. ```ls```

44. Output:
```
binary  data  data5.bin  data6  data8
```
45. ```file data8```

Output:
```
data8: ASCII text
```
46. The ASCII is readable:
```
cat data8
```

Output:
```
The password is FO5dwFsc0cbaIiH0h8J2eUks2vdTDwAn
```

47. The current level is ```exit```.
48. The next level is started:
```
ssh bandit13@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```
49. Output:

Welcome to OverTheWire!

If you find any problems, please report them to the #wargames channel on
discord or IRC.

--[ Playing the games ]--

  This machine might hold several wargames.
  If you are playing "somegame", then:

    * USERNAMES are somegame0, somegame1, ...
    * Most LEVELS are stored in /somegame/.
    * PASSWORDS for each level are stored in /etc/somegame_pass/.

  Write-access to homedirectories is disabled. It is advised to create a
  working directory with a hard-to-guess name in /tmp/.  You can use the
  command "mktemp -d" in order to generate a random and hard to guess
  directory in /tmp/.  Read-access to both /tmp/ is disabled and to /proc
  restricted so that users cannot snoop on eachother. Files and directories
  with easily guessable or short names will be periodically deleted! The /tmp
  directory is regularly wiped.
  Please play nice:

    * don't leave orphan processes running
    * don't leave exploit-files laying around
    * don't annoy other players
    * don't post passwords or spoilers
    * again, DONT POST SPOILERS!
      This includes writeups of your solution on your blog or website!

--[ Tips ]--

  This machine has a 64bit processor and many security-features enabled
  by default, although ASLR has been switched off.  The following
  compiler flags might be interesting:

    -m32                    compile for 32bit
    -fno-stack-protector    disable ProPolice
    -Wl,-z,norelro          disable relro

  In addition, the execstack tool can be used to flag the stack as
  executable on ELF binaries.

  Finally, network-access is limited for most levels by a local
  firewall.

--[ Tools ]--

 For your convenience we have installed a few useful tools which you can find
 in the following locations:

    * gef (https://github.com/hugsy/gef) in /opt/gef/
    * pwndbg (https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg) in /opt/pwndbg/
    * gdbinit (https://github.com/gdbinit/Gdbinit) in /opt/gdbinit/
    * pwntools (https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools)
    * radare2 (http://www.radare.org/)

8. We create a new directory and copy this into a file in it:
```
mkdir /tmp/random_ssh
cd /tmp/random_ssh
vim private.key
```
9. We check existing permissions:
```
ls -l
```

Output:
```
total 4
-rw-rw-r-- 1 bandit16 bandit16 1675 Oct 20 17:33 private.key
```
10. Permissions are changed to make it only open to owner:
```
chmod u=r private.key
chmod g-rw private.key
chmod o-r private.key
```
11. New permissions are checked:
```
ls -l
```

Output:
```

12. The next level is started:
```
ssh -i private.key bandit17@localhost -p 2220

Welcome to OverTheWire!

If you find any problems, please report them to the #wargames channel on
discord or IRC.

--[ Playing the games ]--

  This machine might hold several wargames.
  If you are playing "somegame", then:

    * USERNAMES are somegame0, somegame1, ...
    * Most LEVELS are stored in /somegame/.
    * PASSWORDS for each level are stored in /etc/somegame_pass/.

  Write-access to homedirectories is disabled. It is advised to create a
  working directory with a hard-to-guess name in /tmp/.  You can use the
  command "mktemp -d" in order to generate a random and hard to guess
  directory in /tmp/.  Read-access to both /tmp/ is disabled and to /proc
  restricted so that users cannot snoop on eachother. Files and directories
  with easily guessable or short names will be periodically deleted! The /tmp
  directory is regularly wiped.
  Please play nice:

    * don't leave orphan processes running
    * don't leave exploit-files laying around
    * don't annoy other players
    * don't post passwords or spoilers
    * again, DONT POST SPOILERS!
      This includes writeups of your solution on your blog or website!

--[ Tips ]--

  This machine has a 64bit processor and many security-features enabled
  by default, although ASLR has been switched off.  The following
  compiler flags might be interesting:

    -m32                    compile for 32bit
    -fno-stack-protector    disable ProPolice
    -Wl,-z,norelro          disable relro

  In addition, the execstack tool can be used to flag the stack as
  executable on ELF binaries.

  Finally, network-access is limited for most levels by a local
  firewall.

--[ Tools ]--

 For your convenience we have installed a few useful tools which you can find
 in the following locations:

    * gef (https://github.com/hugsy/gef) in /opt/gef/
    * pwndbg (https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg) in /opt/pwndbg/
    * gdbinit (https://github.com/gdbinit/Gdbinit) in /opt/gdbinit/

## Level 17 to 18:
1. The ```diff``` command is used to print difference between two files:
```
diff passwords.old passwords.new
```
2. Output:
```
42c42
< ktfgBvpMzWKR5ENj26IbLGSblgUG9CzB
---
> x2gLTTjFwMOhQ8oWNbMN362QKxfRqGlO
```
3. As ```passwords.new``` is the second argument, the second difference printed is the key.
4. The next level is started after ```exit``` 17 and 16:
```
ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

## Level 19 to 20:
1. We list the files present using ```ls```.
2. Output:
```
bandit20-do
```
3. We check permissions using ```ls -l```.
4. Output:
```
total 16
-rwsr-x--- 1 bandit20 bandit19 14880 Sep 19 07:08 bandit20-do
```

This means that the user is ```bandit20``` and group is ```bandit19```.

5. We run the command:
```
./bandit20-do
```
6. Output:
```
Run a command as another user.
  Example: ./bandit20-do id
```
7. Thus we can access it as ```bandit20```.
8. We list files in the location mentioned in the instructions:
```
./bandit20-do ls /etc/bandit_pass
```
9. Output:
```
bandit0   bandit11  bandit14  bandit17  bandit2   bandit22  bandit25  bandit28  bandit30  bandit33  bandit6  bandit9
bandit1   bandit12  bandit15  bandit18  bandit20  bandit23  bandit26  bandit29  bandit31  bandit4   bandit7
bandit10  bandit13  bandit16  bandit19  bandit21  bandit24  bandit27  bandit3   bandit32  bandit5   bandit8
```
10. We need to read the file ```bandit20```:
```
./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20
```
11. Output:
```
0qXahG8ZjOVMN9Ghs7iOWsCfZyXOUbYO

12. The current level is ```exit``` and we enter the next level:
```
ssh bandit20@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
