## Cyber Forensics

It involves the investigation of cyberattacks and other illegal activities conducted in the digital space.

Types of threats:
1. Malware is malicious software designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems.
2. Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts data, with attackers demanding payment for the decryption key.
3. Phishing involves social engineering attacks that trick individuals into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords or financial details.
4. DDoS attacks overwhelm a server or network with traffic, making it unavailable to legitimate users.
5. Insider threats are malicious or negligent actions by individuals within the organization that can lead to data breaches or system compromise.

Process:
1. Incident response:
* Isolating infected systems
* Initiating incident documentation

2. Evidence collection

3. Data Preservation

4. Analysis and examination

5. Reporting and documentation



### Tools:
1. EnCase: for analyzing hard drives: recover deleted files, investigate malware, and create court-admissible reports.

2. FTK: used to scan and index large volumes of data, allowing investigators to quickly search for relevant evidence

3. WireShark: network protocol analyzer that allows forensic teams to capture and analyze network traffic in real time, making it possible to detect unusual behavior or data exfiltration.

4. SentialOne: provides advanced endpoint protection with integrated forensic capabilities, making it a valuable tool for incident detection and investigation

5. Autopsy part of sleuthkit: timeline analysis, hash filtering, and keyword search.

6. Bulk Extractor: extracts information without parsing the file system or file system structures, allowing it to access different parts of the disk in parallel, making it faster than the average tool. It can be used to process practically any form of digital media.

7. ExifTool: platform-independent system for reading, writing, and editing metadata across various file types

8. FTK Imager: analyzes images of a drive and preserves the original integrity of the evidence without affecting its original state.

9. Tor: allows users to browse anonymously and prevent identity theft through increased internet security.

10. SIFT Workstation: collection of open-source incident response and forensics technologies designed to perform detailed digital investigations in various settings

### Data Analysis
1. Log analysis: Investigate system and network logs to identify unusual activity, such as unauthorized access attempts, failed login attempts, or unexpected file transfers.

2. Network Traffic analysis: capture and analyze network traffic in real-time, which can reveal patterns that indicate a breach, such as large file transfers to unknown IP addresses

3. Malware analysis: disassembling or reverse-engineering malicious software to understand its functionality and impact. There are two types of malware analysis: static (analyzing the code without executing it) and dynamic (executing the code in a controlled environment to observe its behavior).
